    "This notebook demonstrates Rubick's iterative ability to generate, diagnose, and correct PyTorch loss functions through multiple rounds of refinement.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"The task is to classify images of cats and dogs into their correct categories.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Rubick initially generated incomplete and syntactically invalid loss and test functions. The notebook highlights how:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first loop failed due to a missing implementation and improper indentation.\n",
    "- Rubick restarted the process after exhausting the allowed correction attempts in the first loop.\n",
    "- In the second loop, Rubick again faced multiple errors (e.g., missing imports like torch).\n",
    "- After three correction attempts, it finally produced a valid, executable loss function using F.cross_entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example underscores Rubick’s robustness in handling incomplete or buggy code and its ability to recover through repeated introspection and self-repair — even when initial outputs are severely malformed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this as a reference for understanding how Rubick behaves when generation errors stem from both syntax and import issues."
